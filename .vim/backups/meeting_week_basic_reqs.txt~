Publically accessible web server for fetching images

Other general things we need:
============================
Somewhere for vault to live
vault deployment
Vault packaging


Bootshop (IPXE) Service Needs:
===================

API:
get_ipxe_iso(client_name/az)
  -> returns bytes of ipxe ISO
make_ipxe_iso(client_name/az, signed_client_cert, public_root_cert)
  -> 201 created
  # Always returns the latest version
get_ipxe_config()
  -> return ipxe script
put_ipxe_config()


Things it needs:
=========================
* Access to a private CA somewhere

Bits against Entitlement
  - sign_binary(path_to_binary).  Returns binary.sig
     sign a binary with a trusted signing key.  See make_sig in http://github.com/noelbk/orbital/blob/ipxe/bootshop/bootshop/__init__.py#L369
  - get_server_cert(hostname).  Returns server.cert, server.key, password
     get a trusted cert to serve on hostname
  - get_client_cert(client_name).  Returns client.cert, client.key, password
     get a cert signed by the CA with CN=client_name


Keymaster (Entitlements) Service Needs:
=====================
API:
  check_entitlement(NAME)


Things keymaster needs:
=====================
* We need to acertain with orbital who is going to be calling home again and in what cases



Ops CLI:
=====================
API hooks to Vault to modify certs, revoke certs, etc


Other questions:
=====================
Do we need time-based expiry on our entitlements? We can think of a multitude of cases where someone won't do something in the time allotted and expire out of hand. Servers ordered aren't delivered on time, something takes too long to mail, the IT guy that does this is sick

How are entitlements really supposed to work? How could we possibly enforce them across the board? What stops someone from modifying their configuration and doing it manually?

We might need to revisit why an entitlement doesn't have any *real* power. If they can just modify anything out of band, what do these really do?
  * The argument is these are just officially, provable metrics from the original contract signed, not the enforcement of that contract. It's best effort

Find out who ops is and what do they want out of such a tool

What do people want to see about their entitlements? Do they want to see how close they are to overrunning their entitlements?

There are fields in Salesforce that imply that data is getting pushed back there from the AZ, like "Socket Count in Overage" and "Socket Count from AZ"

What are the unique keys as defined in Salesforce? Hopefully it's the AZ number

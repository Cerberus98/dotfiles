Sprint planning 9/13/2016
=========================

* Focus this sprint is on getting the bugs fixed around the product for the Solar team, getting functional testing in a better spot and lastly getting emails working
* If there's time while we're in SFO, I think we should sit and talk about how we want to scale this going forward.
* There are already quite a few changes in the wireframes that are supposed to be for post-MVP, so there's a fair amount of work there to be done as soon as this lands.
* Meanwhile, we've engaged another team in Cisco on their Smart Licensing product which does some interesting things. At this point it doesn't sound like something we'll end up using
but we'll probably hear them out at least.
* Periodic reminder that everyone needs to be managing their tickets. Several things were PR'd and merged but still marked as in-progres.
* If you make your own tickets, please put them in the current sprint and add story points. Additionally, please add Verification steps, as we're expected to do.
* Lastly, when in doubt, pick something unassigned out of the sprint.

TODO:
* Figure out the deploy host. Update 122 to mention it's blocked on this fact
* Schedule a quick chat with Yagmur and Krsna to talk about survey one-time use token
* Ticket to set up the functional test repo
* Ticket for configuring functional runs

Pixiecore workflow:
===================
# Boot very small host from USB key
# Just enough stuff on it to run pixiecore and a couple other things
  # One of those things is a discovery agent who sends data "home" about all the hosts it finds on the network, with their MACs
# Once discovery is done, it bundles and ships all that data
# A third component starts powering on devices it finds via CIMC/UCS
# Those devices attempt to netboot, calling our original tiny host
# Tiny host calls home and asks for data by MAC Address
# We ship an image kernel and ramdisk back across the connection that boots the node
# We move onto the next node and continue booting until all nodes are booted.

Nova filter scheduler
==================================

Notes:
* Nova differentiates between Host and Cell filters. We'll want to consider something similar for our engine.
* Relies on a configurable list of filters that are defined by the operator. All Host filters implement a host_passes(self, host_state, spec_obj) method, while Cell filters implement filter_all(cells, filter_properties)


Pros:
* Mostly a composition pattern, which makes it easy to extend functionality within the constraints
* Lots of reference filters and other properties we may not have considered otherwise. Definitely useful for research

Cons:
* This will be common across most if not all the schedulers, but it's a single point of failure. Only one scheduler may operate at a time at a given tier.
* Some resource constraints are hard coded into the main path (numa, pci_requests meta)
* Some filters are really collections of multiple sub-filters, and they all take only the current state of the physical machine into account.

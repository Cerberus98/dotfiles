[10:17:30]  <_cerberus_>	morning
[10:17:40]  <clev>	hello!
[10:17:41]  <_cerberus_>	How long is the lease you guys have on that building over by the airport?
[10:17:53]  <clev>	I think its renewed yearly
[10:17:57]  <_cerberus_>	I'm talking with JM about starting a co-working space a little more north central
[10:18:07]  <_cerberus_>	Since we "joked" about it for years in #hh
[10:18:11]  <clev>	lol
[10:18:14]  <_cerberus_>	Trying to gauge interest
[10:18:30]  <clev>	So couple things I guess...
[10:18:36]  <clev>	Cost and parking are huge to those bros
[10:18:43]  <_cerberus_>	Me too
[10:18:53]  <_cerberus_>	I like Geekdom, but I don't go to it because I can't park there
[10:18:53]  <clev>	dedicated space versus adhoc
[10:19:00]  <clev>	obviously as a business you want to provide both
[10:19:09]  <_cerberus_>	Yep
[10:19:17]  <_cerberus_>	Rent offices -> desks -> open floor memberships
[10:19:48]  <clev>	Planet moving to that location could be a hard sell since we did already put a bunch of money into furniture and what not
[10:19:58]  <_cerberus_>	Ah yeah, that's true
[10:19:59]  <_cerberus_>	I forgot about that
[10:20:00]  <clev>	but fwiw we have ~1100 sqft currently. Lemme see how much we pay...
[10:20:56]  <clev>	looks like 2100-2200/mo
[10:21:08]  <_cerberus_>	That's not bad at all
[10:21:08]  <_cerberus_>	ok
[10:21:10]  <clev>	after taxes and all
[10:21:26]  <clev>	yeah its the cheapest of all theplaces we looked but a decent amount
[10:21:50]  <clev>	The company Cushman and Wakefield operate a whole ton of properties on the north central side
[10:21:58]  <clev>	this was the cheapest
[10:22:06]  <_cerberus_>	This is all great info
[10:22:07]  <_cerberus_>	thanks man

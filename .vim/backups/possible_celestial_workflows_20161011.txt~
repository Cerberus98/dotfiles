MMVP
=======================================
Complete the opscli:
  All children of AZs need to be completed
Ship eternity with Oz complete on a single VM without Grant
Implement infoblox API client to fetch MCP1 network config
Figure out how to do CNTRL1 deployments

MMVP Flow:

Ops fills out infoblox as appropriate
Ops creates a customer via the CLI
Ops creates customer user credentials via the CLI
Ops create the AZ via the CLI
Ops completes customer survey via the CLI
  # Glossing over many steps here
Ops uses the client to POST create an IPXE ISO which:
    Fetches Oz data
    Fetches Infoblox data
    Spins cloudinit templates
    Builds IPXE ISO
    Writes it onto the local file system
    Eternity returns a URL pointing to the local filesystem ISO
Ops uses the client to fetch the ISO
Ops burns the ISO to USB
Ops plugs in the USB and boots from it
There should be no additional pre-boot configuration or use of a KVM console


Pros:

Ops is happier sooner

Cons:

We potentially ship without any entitlement information
None of this information is guaranteed to be in SFDC later



MVP
========================================
Complete the opscli
  All children of the AZs need to be completed
Ship eternity complete across 4 VMs
Implement Infoblox API client to fetch MCP1 network config
Figure out how to do CNTRL1 deployments

MVP Flow:
Customer contacts sales and buys an AZ
Sales enters data into salesforce
Grant picks up salesforce record and:
   Tells Oz about it, conditionally creating a customer if none exists and then creating an AZ record
   Tells Scathan about it, creating all entitlements info for the AZ created in OZ
   Tells Eternity to email the customer at the technical contact email address SFDC record (Emailing will be disabled until Ops signs off)
Customer receives the email and conditionally creates their credentials, or logs in with existing ones
Customer fills out the survey
  # Glossing over many steps here
Customer hits "submit" on the survey review screen
Eternity emails a deployment team email address we've configured 
Ops fills out information in infoblox as appropriate
Ops POST creates an ISO using the client, which:
  # Is there a wireframe UI here?
    Fetches Oz data
    Fetches Infoblox data
    Spins cloudinit templates
    Builds IPXE ISO
    eternity uploads to the Candyshop VM
    Eternity returns a URL pointing to the Candyshop VM ISO
Ops fetches the ISO using the returned URL in the previous step
Ops burns the ISO to USB
Ops plugs in the USB and boots from it
There should be no additional pre-boot configuration or use of a KVM console

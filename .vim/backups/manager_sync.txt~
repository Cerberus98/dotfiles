Team status:

We're doing sprint planning today. Still working on getting functional testing together and two of our guys are working on the remainder of the required Oz API functionality. I'm also working on putting together a reservation in xena for the Solar team, so they should be able to hit and integrate against by the end of the day. Other major thing to note is we're several people down through this sprint with two devs on PTO and one actual departure but we're still pushing toward having a functional set of projects by the 13th.

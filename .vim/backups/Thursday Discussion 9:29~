Today's discussion

* Quick chat on the backend hook grant is calling on scathan
* Merging the apps
  - Probably just a code move. Apps stay the same inside the directories, tests move under tests, we rm the rest
  - Grant stays outside
* Enable TLS auth for django and make sure we ship grant with a client cert to consume Eternity
* We're going to keep the opscli separate but drop the pluggability to simplify the packaging around it
* possibly use Nss for entitlement validation
* Let's capture any open questions for product:
  * Who's actually controlling the data that gets entered into salesforce?
    * Ramesh Bodapati rambodap@cisco.com


? Open questions
  Which Salesforce fields are necessary? az_name, metacloud_availability_zone_number, current_state, systemodstamp, account number
  What's the failure workflow? Customer doesn't get the email, how do we recover from it?
  What's the roadmap for AZ updates? Do we expect to allow ops to go manually manage updates or do we push them off until we can automate it fully?
  At the end of the survey submit, do we tell ops and they know how to get the ISO, or do we tell Solar to get the ISO somehow and present the link to the customer to download?
  Are there contract dates in Salesforce for entitlement data?
  When importing existing customers into the system, is there existing entitlement information and can we expect it to be populated if it's not the case?

Action Items:
  All logic moves to eternity
  All objection interaction moves to REST API on the backend of eternity
  We create Contract/SalesforceAZ records in Eternity
  TLS auth
  Don't carry forward the current_state field on the SalesforceAZ model
  New ticket to upload the ISO to candyshop
  Provisioning and setting up candyshop with apache et al
    * Needs a server cert
  What is the data format of the AZ information that they need to boot?
  Where do we put the certs on the MCP? Right now they're installed on a ramdisk, and we need to move them to somewhere on disk
  We need a path to push the entitlements out to the MCP after first boot.
    * Looks like best way is to do a cron fetch over VPN
  Ticket for provisioning eternity lb
  Ticket for db replication
